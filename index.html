  <h1> Privacy Policy for I Hope They Understand </h1>
  <p> 

      Effective date: 04/11/2023 </b>

At I Hope They Understand, we understand the importance of protecting the privacy of children who use our app. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information when children use our app.

</b> Information We Collect </b>

Our app does not collect any personal information from children. However, we do use the SnapChat API Bitmoji kit to provide children with the ability to add Bitmoji stickers to their messages. When children use this feature, we collect non-personal information, such as the type of Bitmoji selected and the date and time the Bitmoji was added to the message.

</b> How We Use Information </b>

We use the non-personal information collected through the SnapChat API Bitmoji kit solely to provide children with the ability to add Bitmoji stickers to their messages. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

</b> Disclosure of Information </b>

We do not disclose any information collected through the SnapChat API Bitmoji kit to any third party, except as required by law.

</b> Third-Party Links </b>

Our app may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party websites or services. We encourage parents and guardians to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services before allowing children to access them.

</b> Changes to Our Privacy Policy </b>

We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it periodically. Your continued use of our app after any modifications or updates to this Privacy Policy will indicate your acceptance of those changes.

</b> Thank you for using our app! </p>
